**write your answers in solution.js**

#### 1. Multiply - Function Declaration
* Create a function named `multiply` that prints the result of multiplying a number by another number.
#### 2. Multiply - Function Declarations as Value
* Create a copy of the above function but change the syntax so that the function declaration is assigned to a variable named `myMultiply`.
#### 3. Multiply - Arrow Function
* Create a copy of the above function but change the syntax so that is uses the arrow function shorthand and store it in a new variable named `myMultiplyFunc`.
#### 4. Declarations
* Create a function to check the remainder of division given two numbers. Use all three declaration options to store copies of it under three names: `remainderOfDivision1`, `remainderOfDivision2` and `remainderOfDivision3`.
